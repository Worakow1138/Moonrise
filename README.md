## Why the Name "Moonrise"?
Since [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is named after the element [Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium), which is named after [Selene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selene), the ancient Greek goddess of the Moon, it only seemed fitting to have a name that incorporated a lunar theme!
